# object_detection
This is an object detection project with yolov5 algorithm.

What you need to do is to create a file in jupyter notebook (optional) and follow the steps in the file yolov5_object_detection.ipynb one by one. You will install the necessary folders and files in this file (yolov5_object_detection.ipynb). So I just uploaded the file containing the code. You can use whatever you want as image or video for object detection in the img variable in the code.
